Spatial prediction and optimal sampling for multivariate functional random fields
Spatial functional data analysis is an alternative approach to spatio-temporal
modeling when the curves are time series varying spatially. Specifically, functional
geostatistics allows to carry out optimal spatial prediction of the whole curve at
unsampled sites. Along with the developments in functional geostatistics, the
framework of the optimal spatial sampling designs has been extended. This package
is concerned with functional kriging, functional cokriging and optimal sampling
designs for spatial prediction of functional data. The methodologies are illustrated
by an application to a dataset taken from the meteorological and air quality networks
of Mexico city.
